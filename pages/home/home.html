  <h2>Welcome to the Katipunan Bank!</h2>

  <p>
   As fellow Filipinos, we understand that income can be difficult in these trying times caused by the pandemic. A lot of people have resorted to using credit cards as funds may be running low. The problem is, people have a hard time knowing how much money they'll have to pay by using their credit cards. People also have a hard time knowing which payment term is best for their specific situation. What better way to know that then by having a calculator that can help calculate that for you! That is why the Katipunan Bank is here to help its fellow kapwa with the newly developed credit card balance transfer calculator application. 
  Created by the proponents of the bank, the calculator in the next tab only needs the bank transfer amount as well as the payment 
  terms in order to calculate three different things: total interest payable, monthly payment, and total amount. With this, knowing 
  your credit card balance has never been easier! Goodluck fellow kapwa, and mabuhay to all Filipinos!
