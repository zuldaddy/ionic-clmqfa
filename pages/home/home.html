  <h2>Welcome to the Katipunan Bank!</h2>

  <p>
  The Katipunan Bank is here to help its fellow kapwa with the newly developed credit card balance transfer calculator application. <br>
  Created by the proponents of the bank, the calculator in the next tab only needs the bank tranfer amount as well as the payment <br>
  terms in order to calculate three different things: total interest payable, monthly payment, and total amount. With this, knowing <br> 
  your credit card balance has never been easier! Goodluck fellow kapwa, and mabuhay to all Filipinos!
